-- recurring_failures.sql — the query bin/derive_rules.py runs against a cc-logger
-- database (https://github.com/…/cc-logger). Also runnable by hand:
--
--   psql "$NEON_CC_LOGGER_URL" -f sql/recurring_failures.sql
--
-- It groups FAILED tool calls by (tool_name, normalized error signature) so a
-- pattern that fails over and over surfaces as one row with a count and a sample
-- command. That row is the raw material for a candidate guard rule.
--
-- Note: this query returns EVERY failing tool. bin/derive_rules.py then drops
-- read-only/context tools (Read, Skill, Glob, Grep, …) before proposing rules — their
-- failures are ordinary agent behaviour, not rule material. If you run this SQL by
-- hand, expect those rows here; that is the raw view, not the candidate list.
--
-- Normalization collapses digits -> #, quoted strings -> 'S', and whitespace, so
-- "database \"foo\" does not exist" and "database \"bar\" does not exist" cluster
-- together. Tune the interval and the HAVING threshold to taste.
